Very quick delivery by Amazon (got delivered way before the expected date). I got a very good deal on exchange offer for my previous IPhone 6s - Nothing wrong with it, however the latest IOS 11 update was taking a toll on the ageing battery, so is the upgrade).\nSince visually similar to 6s to 8, initially did not feel much difference (nowhere the number 8 written on the phone that can easily be seen). However when tried to take photos of fast moving objects the improvement in camera came into instance attention. The phone itself felt very snappy and raring to go on a rampage. Restoring from the previous backup, and take it on to a spin with whatever the daily chores it has to handle.\nWill come back with more updates once the things are settled a bit down).\nPS: I got a Spigen Liquid Crystal Case ordered and put on the phone. It looks much better than the previous Neo hybrid case - just in case anyone wants to know)\n03/SEP/2017\nHere is an update on the battery life. It is very good news, in fact tbe bettery drain is much much lesser than my 6s or a friend's SE.For comparison, I have restored all the settings from 6s and using all the applications.It is possible that after two years of use, 6s's battery is weak. However friend's SE is fresh ( hardly a month old).\nI have decided to add a tempered glass too , after watching iPhone 8 the 'fall tests' popping up in Youtube. Giving a shot to \"PowerBot PB901-i7 World's Thinnest 0.2mm Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 7\" skipping all other famous branded solutions.

Initially things were difficult, because almost everything we could do easily in android, is done in a different/difficult manner. That may change in a few days.\nDisplay :\nI am really not happy with the display quality, when I compare it with the display of my moto G4+, I felt moto G4+ display is more vibrant. Moto G4+ has 401 PPI (1080x1920) display whereas in iphone it's 326 PPI(1334x750). But, Iphone display has more clarity and details on the picture.\nBattery :\nI keep my mobile net and Bluetooth (to pair with smart watch, which means background software will be running for watch sync) ON all the time, so if I charge in the morning, by 6.40 it reaches 30% approx on a medium usage. Otherwise around 50% may be left by end of the day.\nCharging:\nIt wont come with a fast charger, so it takes a bit longer when compared with moto G4+ with fast charger. Moto G4+ with 3000mAh battery takes around 1.5hrs to charge full (May vary based on the network). Compared to this, charging is very slow in Iphone 8.\nUsability : BOTH THE SIDES ARE GLASS, FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAD TO PUT A BACK COVER.\nSize : The only thing I like the most, This is the perfect size for a phone. After using this phone, other bigger display phones might look like a tablet (seriously).\nSound : Good clarity and loud.\nOther features found interesting:\n  a) 3D Touch\n  b) Color of the phone.\n  c) Camera (Not sooo great though)\n  d) Headset\n  e) Siri\n  f) Augmented Reality (AR) games.\nSiri : I use virtual assistants a lot, like cortana of window, google assistant, and now Siri. It's advanced in some area, but lags in some other. For example, using Siri It's easy to book a cab, sending a message in whatsapp using voice commands ..etc. With Google assistant, it's bit difficult (yet possible to an extend).\nKeyboard : Nothing beats google keyboard (gboard), Still using in iOS.\nSpeed : Great response. It has to be for the price paid.\nNow why I chose Iphone over Galaxy note 8?\nReason 1 : Samsung products are for 1 year usage, later it becomes an headache. This is the only reason I dint go for samsung.\nOtherwise feature wise, look wise, value for money wise it's super cool.\nTell me your views on it.", "product_id": "B0719KYGMQ", "author_name": "Amazon Customer", "source_id": 1},

Just pay a look and you'll be glad you did.\nLet's get on with it.\n=====PROS=====\n-Body:\u00a0Aluminum 7000 frame, reinforced glass front and rear, IP67 certified for water and dust resistance. Gold, Space Gray, and Silver color options.\n-Screen:\u00a04.7\" 16M-color LED-backlit IPS LCD screen of 750p resolution, 326ppi, True Tone adjustment via four-channel ambient light sensor, wide color gamut, 3D Touch.\n-OS:\u00a0Apple iOS 11.\n-Chipset:\u00a0Hexa-core (2 Monsoon + 4 Mistral) 2.09GHz Apple CPU, tri-core Apple GPU, 2GB of RAM, Apple A11 Bionic SoC.\n-Camera:\u00a012MP camera with F/1.8 lens, optical image stabilization, quad-LED flash with slow sync, phase detection auto focus, wide color capture.\n- Video recording:\u00a02160p@60/30fps, 1080p@30/60/120/240fps video recording.\n-Selfie:\u00a07MP F/2.2 front-facing camera with BSI sensor and HDR mode, 1080p@30fps video.\n-Storage:\u00a064GB or 256GB of built-in storage.\n-Connectivity:\u00a04G LTE Cat.12; Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac; Bluetooth 5.0; Lightning port; GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, QZSS; NFC (Apple Pay only).\n-Battery:\u00a01,821mAh battery, wireless charging (Qi compatible).\n-Misc:\u00a0Stereo speakers, pressure-sensitive Home key with fingerprint scanner, Taptic Engine.\n=====CONS=====\n-Poor screen-to-body ratio (too much bezel for the size).\n-No 3.5mm audio jack (ships with a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter).\n-No microSD slotiTunes is still required for manual music upload.\n-No fast charger provided in the box (and the optional one is expensive).\n-Video camera still recording mono audio only.\n=====THOUGHTS=====\nThis should have been a 7S. That simple. But it's complicated. Too complicated perhaps for Apple as we used to know it. On paper - and in actual fact - there's enough new stuff in that package. Yet, the Apple iPhone 8 doesn't go beyond the iterative upgrade we've come to expect from an S model. Is it because it's impossible to not take into account the iPhone X? Or is it the new all-glass design is looking too familiar?\nMaybe it's the way Cupertino handled some of the upgrades. Like the camera did get better thanks to a new sensor and larger pixel size but Apple isn't exactly verbose about the new imaging technology. There's fast-charging support too but with a caveat: you're not getting it right out of the box. Not with the supplied charger and cabling.That, and the steep price may give Apple a hard time justifying the iPhone 8, especially to iPhone 7 users. With no intention whatsoever to downplay the good stuff about the iPhone 8, the new model and its spec sheet are pretty predictable. The price is therefore a bit of a surprise - and not a pleasant one either. Then again, Apple's never had a problem getting the price it thinks is right. Plus, the iPhone 8 may turn out to be convincing enough. We're back right after the break to pop the box open and begin to find out.\n=====CONCLUSION=====\nNo doubt, that's it's one of the best phones of 2017 but the fact that iPhone X is around the corner, purchasing this makes no sense but if the Home button and the Touch ID is a big deal for you, this is definitely a good choice.\nIf this review was helpful, please consider clicking on the helpful tab.

Upgraded from iPhone 7 64gb. If you're Apple person, almost no learning curb. Price though is stratospheric though cheaper than iPhone X.\nUnit is blazing fast compared to my old iPhone. Screen is not OLED but still look wonderful with True Tone feature. Lost use of some software because developers did not upgrade their software from 32-bit to 64-bit. Speaker sound is much improved and really it is pleasure to listen while watching movie. Even though optical zoom is only 2x, it is nice to have. Digital zoom will go up to 10x but you pay in term of graininess.\nGuts are virtually same as iPhone X. Probably the last of \"old-style\" iPhone and most perfect in term of integration of software and hardware.\nWill do wireless charging but you'll have to pony up extra money for charger and stand. Unfortunately, it will not fast charge like some Samsung android smart phone.\nBest to invest in good case and screen protector as unit has glass back (to facilitate wireless charging).\nSnappy. Expensive. Camera Fantastic. iOS 11 very productive. True tone display easy on the eye. Wireless charging is awesome!\nI have a Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Note 8 has many features and I love most, particularly Samsung Pay which works at way more places than Apple Pay does. Stylus is good to scribble stuff. Display is fantastic. iPhone 8 Plus with its execution (app performance) and Apple Watch Series 2 experience trumps Note 8 W/ Frontier S3 Watch.\nMy old iPhone 7 Plus leather case from Apple worked just fine. The fast chargers I use with Note 8 work just fine with iPhone 8 Plus with the case on. This is my most favorite feature so far. True tone display and the snappy cameras with portrait lighting gives the extra edge over Note 8.\niOS 11 is snappy. Migration of data from iPhone 7 Plus was made lot easy & quick with the new Apple Watch like transfer feature.\nAll in all, great for productivity seekers, fashion statement & everything in between.", "product_id": "B0719KYGMQ", "author_name": "SwordFish", "source_id": 1},

This means it does feel somewhat dated, especially when placed down next to\u00a0Samsung's Galaxy S8, although those fond of Apple's go-to design unlikely will have any complaints.\u00a0\n\u2022 \u200eThis dated feel is largely down to the\u00a0chunky bezels that surround\u00a0the 4.7in screen, with Apple's rivals - and even Apple itself - making the move towards full-screen, bezel-free devices. This does mean that there's room for Apple's trusty Touch ID sensor underneath the display, though, which has so far worked flawlessly every time.\n\u2022 \u200eLike the\u00a0iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is waterproof too, thanks to the handset's IP67 certification which means, in theory, it should withstand being dunked into water up to 1 metre for 30 minutes. This has rung true for us so far, but we\u00a0try and avoid getting the handset too wet given its exposed ports on the bottom.\u00a0\n\u2022 \u200eThe iPhone 8 is a tad heavier than last year's iPhone 7 at 148g, which we found made it feel more robust. It apparently is, according to Apple, which boasts that the glass on the phone's rear is the \"most durable glass ever on an iPhone.\" We haven't managed to drop our iPhone 8 yet, but it feels like it could withstand a tumble or two.\n\u2022 \u200eElsewhere on the handset you'll find the Lightning port on the bottom edge is flanked by a speaker and microphone, and there's nothing up top. There's no return for the 3.5mm audio jack, but Apple includes a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box.\n\u2022 \u200eThere's also updated stereo speakers, which make the phone around 25 percent louder than the iPhone 7.\n\u2714\ufe0f DISPLAY:\n\u2022 The iPhone 8's display is largely identical to the iPhone 7. And the 6S, and, er, the iPhone 6. This means that the 4.7in screen, with its 1,334x750 resolution, does feel somewhat\u00a0old-fashioned, not to mention small, compared to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2, again, added to by the bezels that surround it. Quality wise, while it pales against its rivals on paper, we've no complaints, and it continues to be among the sharpest and most vibrant on the market.\n\u2022 \u200eThe only real change to the iPhone 8's screen is the addition of Apple's True-Tone technology that first debuted on the 9.7in iPad Pro.\u00a0This True Tone alters the colour temperature of the display depending on the environment in which you're in, reducing the harsh blue tones typical of an LCD when you're in a\u00a0dimly lit room.\n\u2714\ufe0f PERFORMANCE:\n\u2022 Apple's new A11 Bionic chip sits under the hood of the iPhone 8 and, as expected, it's incredibly fast.\n\u2022 \u200eSpecs-wise, the six-core CPU comprises of two low-performance cores and four high-performance cores, with the regular cores being 25 per cent faster than the previous A10 chip, and the high-performance cores being up to 75 per cent faster than the A10 SoC, according to Apple It also comes paired with Apple's first homegrown GPU, which offers 30 per cent more performance than the A10.\n\u2714\ufe0f SOFTWARE:\n\u2022 The iPhone 8 ships with iOS 11, naturally, which brings\u00a0with it improvements to Siri, reworked lock screen notifications, a new-look Control Centre and Apple's redesigned App Store.\n\u2714\ufe0f CAMERA:\n\u2022 On paper,\u00a0the main camera on the iPhone 8 is no different to that found on the iPhone 7, with Apple retaining the same 12MP sensor with built-in f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilisation (OIS).\n\u2022 \u200eThe biggest changes come on the video side of things with 4K recording now available at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - both of which are double the iPhone 7 and the former is a first for any smartphone.\n\u2022 \u200eI tried it out in a variety of different lighting conditions, indoor and out, and\u00a0were impressed with the camera's capabilities - in particular when low lighting is involved, something our iPhone 8 struggled to cope with. This is aided by the always-on HDR, which increases saturation while retaining more natural and realistic colours than images shot on the Note 8, for example.\u00a0\n\u2022 \u200eThe biggest changes are seen on the video side,\u00a0with 4K recording now available at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - double what the iPhone 7 has on offer.\n\u2022 \u200eOn the front of the phone you'll find a 7MP camera f/2.2 aperture, Retina Flash and 1080p video recording,\u00a0and while this isn't as great in low-light as the rear-facing snapper, it's perfectly good enough for the occasional selfie and Snapchatting, or whatever it is you kids get up to. Unfortunately, however, you don't get Apple's new Portrait Mode on the iPhone 8, nor the new Portrait Lighting feature that the iPhone 8 Plus has.\n\u2714\ufe0f BATTERY LIFE:\n\u2022 According to Apple, the battery inside the iPhone 8 will\u00a0last around two hours longer than the iPhone 7's, despite weighing in slightly smaller at\u00a01,821mAh.This has proved accurate during my time with the iPhone 8 so far. It usually gets me to the end of the day - just, whereas I usually had to charge my iPhone 8 most evenings.\n\u2022 \u200eIt's much less of a hassle to charge the iPhone 8 too, as it - along with the iPhone X - is Apple's first smartphone to support wireless charging. What's more, whereas Apple usually requires expensive propriety accessories, the iPhone 8 supports the Qi wireless charging standard, which means it'll work with most third-party charges on the market.\u00a0\n\u2714\ufe0f VERDICT:\n\u2022 In short the iPhone 8 is an excellent phone and there are some great new editions to get excited about, such as the inclusion of wireless charging for the first time and Apple's new A11 Bionic CPU, which is benchmarks are anything to go by, is the fastest mobile CPU on the market right now.\u00a0\n\u2022 \u200eBeyond that, though, the iPhone 8 is an incremental update over last year's iPhone 7, and its large bezels and three-year-old design mean it does feel somewhat dated compared to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel XL 2, despite carrying a similarly-expensive price-tag.\u00a0\nThank You PEACE..\n( IF YOU FIND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL PLEASE HIT THE 'HELPFUL YES VOTE')", "product_id": "B0719KYGMQ", "author_name": "Toshi Aley", "source_id": 1},

It is a lot better in low lights conditions.\nSPEED, I was using a 7 and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 11 but pages pop really fast. It is way faster than the original 7.\nGold (Pink-gold) looks awesome!!! But is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. Most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.\nAny case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 8. But most likely all other will not. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!\nOverall I love it! Fastest & best device that I have ever used. I can out type the 7 sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.\n56 gb is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256gb.\nThe adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 7 and the 8 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 8 with the adapter sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 8 audio is fine.\nIPhone 4,5, 5s, SE, 6 and 6s users will feel a huge speed increase. The 7 is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.", "product_id": "B0719KYGMQ", "author_name": "Shubham Sharma", "source_id": 1},

Here's why", "comments_count": "6", "review_text": "Got my phone delivered last week, and I am impressed. Below are my thoughts about this product. Views are strictly personal and mean no harm to users of other phones.\nA lot of people are in a dilemma whether this phone is any improvement over iPhone 7? My verdict: Absolutely YES. First its a newer generation phone with a more powerful chipset underneath. The difference in price between iPhone 7, 32GB and iPhone 8, 64 GB model is hardly 11k. So you get:\n- a faster processor(by upto 70%),\n- Better CAMERA(Best camera at launch, improved lowlight images, much better image processing),\n- WIRELESS CHARGING\n- 2x memory.\n- Louder and better quality speaker\n- True tone brightness (helps to protect your eyes, is different from night mode)\n- Moreover since its a newer model, apple will provide the support for this device for 1 year more than iPhone 7.\nAll this for just 11k more. And since its upto 70% faster than iPhone 7, it will show much better performance in later years as compared to iPhone 7. If you plan to keep your phone beyond 2 years then 8 should be your pick. It can easily serve you well for 4 years, and will be on the latest software for at-least 5 years(which is 2022, going by apple's support cycle for current phones, example: iphone 5s was launched in 2013 and still gets the latest iOS 11).\niPhone 8 vs iPhone X?\niPhone X is a rockstar, Show stopper. It has got a better camera and all but its still costs a whopping 33k more!! All you missout in iPhone 8 compared to iPhone X is:\n- Dual lens camera (8 plus has it)\n- Face detection (much talked about, though some people prefer the touch id)\n- Bezel less display (Showoff stuff IMO)\n- THATS ALL!!\nPlus points\n- iPhone 8 has the exact same chipset under its skin.\n- Has wireless charging same as iPhone X!\n- Retains the old tried, tested and loved touch id.\n- Has the same no-nonsense and durable iPhone design that people have trusted for years!!\nI think that I have emphasized enough on why iPhone 8 is the phone to buy and would not let you down.", "product_id": "B0719KYGMQ", "author_name": "Mayank Pahuja", "source_id": 1},

Its starting storage size is a roomy 64GB, double that of the iPhone 7.\nThe Bad :- This phone has the same pedestrian design, missing headphone jack and battery life as the iPhone 7 -- and no dual camera either. The iPhone 8 costs a bit more than baseline new iPhones in years past, and comes only in black, silver and a new shade of gold.\nThe Bottom Line The iPhone 8 has plenty of power under the hood, but lacks the extra camera features and design upgrade of the better iPhone 8 Plus and X.", "product_id": "B0719KYGMQ", "author_name": "vipin parmar", "source_id": 1},
