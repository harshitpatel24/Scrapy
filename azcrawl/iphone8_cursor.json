But if you have a good back cover, No worries....\nCamera(i have compared the quality with several dual cam phones),dispaly and memory management is at its best for my usage. Audio also looks good.\nSince i have no wireless charger,no comments on that.\nAnd you know, the phone\u2019s cost, only if you are confident to buy, go for it. Won\u2019t dissatisfy you.\nLoved the phone not by the brand, but by what it has...", "review_date": "17 February 2018", "stars": "5", "author_name": "Nandakishor.U.M", "comments_count": "0"},
